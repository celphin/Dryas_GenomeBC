 DNA methylation and RNAseq analyses
 
 ## Methylation
  nf-core Methylseq for WGBS mapping and calling methylated C's \
  Metilene for detecting differentially methylated regions \
 
 ## RNAseq - mRNA
  RSEM for mapping to transcriptome 
  EdgeR for normalization and plotting heat maps
 
 ## Bedtools Union to compare
